# Version Control Workflow Project (with Git & GitHub)
This project simulates a real-life Git and GitHub workflow where two collaborators (Tom and Jerry) make changes to the same HTML file from different Git branches. It involves cloning a repo, branching, editing files, making commits, pushing to GitHub, and creating pull requests to merge changes.
## 1. Initial Setup
### . Git Version
I verified the installation of git by running git --version
![git --version](./Git%20version.png)
### . Cloned the GitHub Repository

This copies an existing Git repository into your local computer

## 2. Pulled Latest Changes
![Git Pull](./git%20pull.png)

## 3. Created Tom's Branch
![Git checkout -b name](./Tom%20Branching.png)

## 4. Created Index.html for Tom

### . Code Index.html
This allows to enter and add Tom's update.

### . Git Commit
![Git Commit](./Git%20commit%20Tom%209.png)

## 6. Pushed Tom's Branch to GitHub
![Git push](./Git%20push%20for%20Tom11.png)

## 7. Created Jerry's Branch
### . Switched to main first
![git checkout main](./Jerry%20Branching.png)
### . Created and Switched To Jerry's Branch
![git checkout -b](./Jerry%20Branching.png)

## 8. Pulled Tom's Changes Into Jerry's Branch
![git pull](./Jerry%20pull%20request.png)

## 9. Edited index.html as Jerry and Added Jerry's Update Below Tom's

## With this, I Have successfully simulated a two-person Git collaboration with realistic branch management, file editing, and pull requests.
