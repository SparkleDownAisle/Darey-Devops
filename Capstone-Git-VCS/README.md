### Version Control Workflow Project (with Git & GitHub)
This project simulates a real-life Git and GitHub workflow where two collaborators (Morgan and Jamie) make changes to the same HTML file from different Git branches. It involves cloning a repo, branching, editing files, making commits, pushing to GitHub, and creating pull requests to merge changes.
